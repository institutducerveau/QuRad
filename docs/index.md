## What is QuRad?

QuRad is an open-source [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/) tool that extracts up to 119 radiomic features (103 enabled by default) directly from cell detections and user-defined regions, without any external plugins or libraries. Its output has been validated feature by feature against PyRadiomics. It is available in two interchangeable forms that share the same validated feature-extraction code:

- an **installable QuPath extension** (a `.jar` with a menu command and settings dialog), and
- a **self-contained Groovy script** that you paste into QuPath's Script Editor.

QuRad works on **2D whole slide images (WSI)** in 8-bit RGB and computes the features on a grayscale image derived from RGB luminance. It has been validated on H&E histopathology images and runs on **QuPath 0.6 and 0.7**.

The features can be used to classify cells, characterize tissue regions, assess tissue quality or train machine-learning models. The extraction runs inside QuPath, so the values can be explored there directly, for example in measurement maps.

This documentation covers **QuRad 0.4** (script `QuPath_Radiomics_v3.groovy`, extension `qupath-extension-qurad-0.4.0`). Source code and releases are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/institutducerveau/QuRad).

## Output and Feature Classes

QuRad extracts 103 features by default, organized into 7 classes, plus an optional legacy class. For a detailed description of each feature, see the [Feature Reference](features.md).

| Class | Features | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **First-order** | 19 | on | Intensity statistics (mean, variance, entropy, etc.) |
| **Shape 2D** | 10 | on | 2D geometric features (area, perimeter, sphericity, axis lengths) |
| **GLCM** | 23 | on | Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix texture features |
| **GLRLM** | 16 | on | Gray Level Run Length Matrix features |
| **GLSZM** | 16 | on | Gray Level Size Zone Matrix features |
| **NGTDM** | 5 | on | Neighborhood Gray Tone Difference Matrix |
| **GLDM** | 14 | on | Gray Level Dependence Matrix features |
| **Shape (legacy 3D names)** | 16 | off | 2D quantities under PyRadiomics' 3D shape names; not recommended |
