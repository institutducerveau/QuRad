Radiomics feature extraction inside QuPath.

QuRad computes 103 radiomic features for every cell detection or annotation region in an
image and writes them to a CSV, without any export to Python or other external tools. The features are
the PyRadiomics definitions (first-order, 2D shape, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTDM, GLDM), and
every one of them has been checked against PyRadiomics 3.0.1 on identical pixel masks.

Documentation: https://institutducerveau.github.io/QuRad/

## Install

QuRad works on QuPath 0.6 and 0.7 and comes in two forms that give identical results.

**Extension.** Download `qupath-extension-qurad-<version>.jar` from
[Releases](https://github.com/institutducerveau/QuRad/releases), drag it onto the QuPath window and
restart. You get a menu entry, **Extensions ▸ QuRad ▸ Extract radiomics features…**, with a
settings dialog. To build it yourself: `cd extension && ./gradlew build` (JDK 21). The jar
lands in `extension/build/libs/`.

**Script.** Open `src/QuPath_Radiomics_v3.groovy` in QuPath's script editor and run it. The
settings are the block at the top of the file. Because QuPath can run a script on every image
in a project (**Run ▸ Run for project…**), this is the easy way to process a whole batch.

## Use

Open an image that has cell detections (from QuPath's own cell detection, StarDist, Cellpose,
or imported GeoJSON) or annotation regions, run QuRad, and choose what to process and which
feature classes you want. Images must be 8-bit RGB brightfield. Anything else is refused with
a message.

For every image QuRad writes two files into `<project>/radiomics/`:

```
<image>_radiomics_<timestamp>.csv             one row per object, 112 columns
<image>_radiomics_<timestamp>_settings.json   QuRad and QuPath versions, image, calibration, every parameter
```

The CSV has 9 metadata columns (image, object ID, type, class, centroid, pixel count, pixel
size) and the 103 features, named `class_FeatureName` as in PyRadiomics without its `original_` prefix. The values can
also go straight into QuPath's measurement table for measurement maps and classifiers.

Defaults: bin width 25, GLCM distance 1 pixel, texture matrices summed over the four in-plane
directions (PyRadiomics `weightingNorm='no_weighting'`). A 16-feature class of 2D quantities
reported under PyRadiomics' 3D shape names is available for old pipelines but off by default.
Details of every convention are in the [feature reference](https://institutducerveau.github.io/QuRad/features/).

Single-threaded, about 1,900 nuclei per second on a server CPU.

## Reproducing the paper

Three notebooks produce the validation and classification results of the article from the feature tables
included here:

| Notebook | Shows | Runtime |
|---|---|---|
| `notebooks/validation.ipynb` | feature-by-feature agreement with PyRadiomics 3.0.1, plus synthetic edge cases | ~15 s |
| `notebooks/example_application_puma.ipynb` | tumour vs lymphocyte classification on 20 PUMA melanoma tiles | ~9 min |
| `notebooks/example_application_tiger.ipynb` | tissue-compartment classification on 6 TIGER breast-cancer slides | ~1 min |

The environment is Python 3.10. PyRadiomics 3.0.1 has no wheel for current Python versions and
builds from source against the installed NumPy (this needs a C compiler), so NumPy goes first:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.26.4 setuptools wheel
pip install --no-build-isolation -r requirements.txt jupyterlab
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

Only the first notebook needs PyRadiomics installed. The two application notebooks read the
QuRad output exactly as QuPath writes it (`example_data/*/radiomics/`), so if you re-extract in
QuPath and drop the new files there, they analyse yours.

Notebook 1 compares QuRad with PyRadiomics on identical pixel masks. Both sides are in
`example_data/*/pyradiomics/` (the QuRad command-line run, the exported masks and the PyRadiomics output). To
regenerate them from the images:

```bash
cd extension && ./gradlew headless -PrunnerArgs="--image <tif> --objects <geojson> --out <dir>/qurad.csv --masks <dir>/masks --grayOut <dir>/gray.png"
python notebooks/lib/pyradiomics_extract.py --image <tif> --gray <dir>/gray.png --masks <dir>/masks --out <dir>/pyradiomics_noweighting.csv
```

The timing benchmark (Table S3, Figure S3) is rerun with `notebooks/lib/run_benchmark.sh` on an
idle machine and summarised with `python notebooks/lib/benchmark_report.py`. The raw timings,
including CPU model and JVM, are in `example_data/benchmark/`.

The code the notebooks import is in `notebooks/lib/`, and everything they write goes to
`notebooks/results/` (tables, figures, per-object predictions). `QURAD_DATA` and
`QURAD_RESULTS` override the input and output folders. After the notebooks have run,
`python notebooks/lib/report.py` formats Tables 3, 4 and S2 to S6 of the article from their
outputs.
